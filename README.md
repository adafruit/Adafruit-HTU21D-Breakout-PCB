The HTU21D-F Temperature + Humidity Sensor - the best way to prove the weatherman wrong!

This I2C digital humidity sensor is an accurate and intelligent alternative to the much simpler Humidity and Temperature Sensor - SHT15 Breakout It has a typical accuracy of ±2% with an operating range that's optimized from 5% to 95% RH. Operation outside this range is still possible - just the accuracy might drop a bit. The temperature output has an accuracy of ±1°C from -30~90°C. If you're looking to measure temperature more accurately, we recommend the MCP9808 High Accuracy I2C Temperature Sensor Breakout Board.
